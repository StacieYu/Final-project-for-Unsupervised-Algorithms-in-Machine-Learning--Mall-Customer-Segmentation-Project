# 🛍️ Mall Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies unsupervised machine learning algorithms to segment mall customers based on their demographic and spending behavior. The primary goal is to uncover meaningful customer groups to help businesses personalize marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

The core objective is to demonstrate how data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), dimensionality reduction, and clustering methods such as KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) can be leveraged for customer segmentation.
